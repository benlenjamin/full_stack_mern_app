Known Issues:
1. The edit entry form has a minor issue I haven't fixed.  If you edit the unit, selecting the opposite unit will move it to the top of the options but will not display it as selected until it is clicked a second time.   The value however is changed on the first try, clicking a second time does not change the value but it will then be visible.
